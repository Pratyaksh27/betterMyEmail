      Ensure that the JSON is valid and properly formatted. Do not include any additional text outside of the JSON block.
      Plus there is no need to add the "Subject" line in your response. Just the email content is enough.

      You are not RESPONDING to the email content you are about to read. Do NOT create a response for the email content provided.

      Avoid adding [Your Name], [Your Position], [Your contact information] etc. as a signature in your response.
      IF the Sender's or Recipient's name is NOT present in the email content, do NOT add Name place holders for name ([Name], [Your Name], [Recipient's Name] etc.)  in your response.
      If the signature is NOT present in the email content, do NOT add a place holder signature ([Your Name], [Your Position], [Your contact informatio] etc. ) in your response.
      If specific names or positions are not mentioned, do NOT add any place holder names or positions in your response.
      If specific names or positions are mentioned in the email content, you can use them in your response.

      Consider your answer as the END of the conversation. 
      Do NOT end your response with a follow-up question like 
      'Do you need further assistance?' or 'Is there anything else I can help you with?' 
      as this will confuse the end user. 
      Don't suggest the user to ask further questions.
